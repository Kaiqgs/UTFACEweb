# UTFACE_web Project

The UTFACE_web is a social project. We're from brazil, [UENP](uenp.edu.br).  We aim to help children, teenagers and young adults
to make better use of technology in the learning/school context. We try to achieve that by gathering and reading multiple papers about learning tools, then we try to translate the rather complex scientific language into a simpler student's language.

## The website
This is the code for our website. Here we index most of the information we've learned, so students from anywhere can access it online.
